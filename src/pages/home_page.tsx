      <p>
        I am a computational biologist at the Center for Genomic Regulation in
        Barcelona. I'm currently working on my master's project in Roderic
        Guig√≥'s lab. I work on large language models for automated genome
        annotation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also do game development in the startup Vistula Development. I'm
        working on an arcade racing video game called Track Racer. I focus on
        the game's user interface, visual effects, and visual assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I study web development. I also do vocal performance
        (mainly choral), vocal composition, and marine sailing.
